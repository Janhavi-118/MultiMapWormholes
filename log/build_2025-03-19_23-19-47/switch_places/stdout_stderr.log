[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findswitch_places_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "switch_places_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "switch_places_msgs" with any of the following names:

    switch_places_msgsConfig.cmake
    switch_places_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "switch_places_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "switch_places_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "switch_places_msgs" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
