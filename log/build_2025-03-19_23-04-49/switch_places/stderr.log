[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:21 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findswitch_places.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "switch_places", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "switch_places"
  with any of the following names:

    switch_placesConfig.cmake
    switch_places-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "switch_places" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "switch_places_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "switch_places" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
